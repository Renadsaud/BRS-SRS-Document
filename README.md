# BRS-SRS-Document
Software Requirements Specifications document (SRS) and Business Requirements Specifications document (BRS) we used both documents in the development process for The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture revenue management systems. (Project For Software Engineering Cours). We used the waterfall model, and we created the prototype with Adobe XD.

# What is the SRS and BRS Document?
SRS is represented as System Requirement Specification while BRS is represented as Business Requirement Specification.
<br/>
The Business Requirement Specification (BRS) is a formal document that specifics the customer's requirement, written or verbal.
<br/>
The Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document defines the functional and non-functional needs of the software to be established.
<br/>
SRS is obtained from the BRS, whereas BRS is acquired from customer statements and their business needs.
<br/>
Main goals and objectives of the project:
The goal of the project is to build an integrated system to manage the revenues that are collected so that a set of relevant systems is provided that will work to unify and collect all information, data, and work procedures related to it, which are summarized in four main tracks (Property management system - violation management system - invoice management system - customer services management system). 

# Main functionality and characteristics: Five main functions:
<br/>
• first function: property management
<br/>
• second function: Violations Management The purpose of the violation control procedure 
<br/>
• third function: billing management
<br/>
• fourth function: customer relationship management system
<br/>
• Fifth function: communications and cases
<br/>

The Ministry serves several sectors: public, environment, water, agriculture, lands, surveying, livestock, and fisheries. 
It also serves various groups: individuals, the business sector, government agencies, visitors to the Kingdom, volunteer associations, and green associations.

# Intended users and key usability goals:
The system targets employees to enable them to manage the operation, maintenance, marketing, and collection of rents or installments from tenants or investors, such as land services that contribute to supporting Saudi agriculture in allocating and leasing agricultural lands to investors and services aimed at achieving the desired justice in relation to agricultural land issues.
<br/>
The system also targets a procedure for controlling violators to detect a violation committed as a result of a wrong practice or as a result of its failure to comply with the controls and standards.
<br/>
And the ministry benefits from the invoice management system, which in turn records all types of invoices issued by the ministry with all the revenues that it collects to save time and effort.
<br/>
Also, it provides a system to manage customer relations, complaints, issues, and reports to provide customer requirements and achieve their satisfaction and resolve complaints faster and more efficiently.

# Software Development Life Cycle:
- After reading the project requirements and analyzing them in detail, we found that the best option for implementing the project is a waterfall model because the project is affiliated with the Ministry and its requirements are clearly and accurately stated by the Ministry.
<br/>
- And because the system requirements are all mentioned, they do not change continuously and suddenly.
<br/>
- The scope of the project is well-defined.
<br/>
- Because the project 
<br/>

# Characteristics :
• Create an application or site that benefits the ministry, users and society
<br/>
• Establishing the project in the required time, with good cost and good technical performance 
<br/>
• Project planning and management to achieve goals according to specifications
